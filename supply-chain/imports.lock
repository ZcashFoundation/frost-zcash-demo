uses of `unsafe` have been reviewed in https://crrev.com/c/5178771 and the
**delta**  was evaluated as `ub-risk-3` - no known unsoundness but:
* Little safety comments to explain why a particular usage of `unsafe`

* Safety analysis couldn't be done locally, but required considering the
  whole crate (e.g. checking if the public `Ref.ptr` is mutated anywhere)

checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can

Most of the `unsafe` changes are cleaning up their usage:
- Replacing `data.len() * std::mem::size_of::<$ty>()` with `std::mem::size_of_val(data)`.
- Removing some `mem::transmute`s.
- Using `*mut` instead of `*const` to convey intended semantics.

A new unsafe trait method `SockaddrLike::set_length` is added; it's impls look fine.

Most of the crate is code to parse and validate the output of `rustc -vV`. The caller can
choose which `rustc` to use, or can use `rustc_version::{version, version_meta}` which will
try `$RUSTC` followed by `rustc`.

If an adversary can arbitrarily set the `$RUSTC` environment variable then this crate will
execute arbitrary code. But when this crate is used within a build script, `$RUSTC` should
be set correctly by `cargo`.
